Beijing is one of the oldest city in the world. It was established as the capital of kingdom Yan more than 3000 years ago. Yet, Beijing is also an energetic city as the economic and political center of China. In Beijing, ancient sightseeings are in harmonized symbiosis with modern skycrapers. Every morning, youngters in suits and tie walk through the thousand-year-old arch. The high-tech hub, Zhongguancun, also witnesses the peaceful scenery in the Summer Palace. Tradition and modernity coexist in the city, forming the unique sightseeing, culture and environment in Beijing.
